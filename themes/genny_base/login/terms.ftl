                    <p>Welcome to Sonar! Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our websites, products, services, and applications (the "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>These Terms of Service (the "<strong>Terms</strong>") are a binding contract between you and Get Sonar, Inc. ("<strong>Sonar</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>" and "<strong>us</strong>"). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don't have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>What is Sonar?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>The Sonar Services offer a safety and wellbeing software that facilitates proactive evidence-based interventions for youth.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>If you are a youth in the United States over the age of 13, you may register for an account with us and designate up to ten individuals to be a "mental health ally" (each, a "<strong>Mental Health Ally</strong>").</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>As further described in the Services, your Mental Health Allies may receive alerts and notifications regarding your safety and wellbeing ("<strong>Notifications</strong>") based on your use of the third-party websites, services and social media accounts that you connect to from the Services (collectively, the "<strong>Third Party Services</strong>"), as well as prompts and surveys sent by us. Although we generally will not share with your Mental Health Allies specific posts or messages you send us or post on Third Party Services, as part of the Notifications, we may provide your Mental Health Allies with some context on how you may be feeling or thinking or on why we sent a particular Notification. Our Services use a mix of in-house and third-party mental health clinicians ("<strong>Safety Monitors</strong>") and automated technologies and processes to review Third Party Content (as defined below) and data collected by the Services, and to draft and review Notifications that are sent to Mental Health Allies.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>All personal data collected by us will always remain subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h2>What are the basics of using Sonar?</h2>
                    <ul style="list-style:none">
                        <li><h3><em>Youth Registration</em></h3>
                            <p>
                                Youths will be required to sign up for an account and select a password and username ("<strong>User ID</strong>"). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your User ID a name that you don't have the right to use, or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
                            </p> 
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Once you are registered for the Services, you may designate your Mental Health Allies, who may receive Notifications based on your use of the Services and of Third Party Services. You hereby agree that we may deliver Notifications to your Mental Health Allies as part of the Services. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, at all times while you are registered for the Services, at least one of your Mental Health Allies shall be your parent or legal guardian or caregiver (each such adult, an "<strong>Adult Mental Health Ally</strong>"), and you represent and warrant that any person designated as such is your parent or legal guardian or caregiver.</p>

                            <p>If you are invited to become a Mental Health Ally, you may be required to sign up for an account to receive Notifications, otherwise you may be contacted to receive Notifications and other Services-related alerts as specified by the Services. You agree to these Terms by your use of the Services. If you would like to remove yourself as a Mental Health Ally, please contact <a href="mailto:support@sonarmentalhealth.com">support@sonarmentalhealth.com</a></p>

                            <p>As described above, Mental Health Allies may receive Notifications based on their linked youths' use of Third Party Services and interactions with us.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Sonar may, in its sole discretion, determine on a case-by-case basis which Mental Health Allies will receive a Notification. For example, there may be some Notifications that Sonar determines are appropriate for all Mental Health Allies to receive. Alternatively, there may be some Notifications that Sonar determines warrants only alerting Adult Mental Health Allies or all Mental Health Allies except for Adult Mental Health Allies. To learn more about our methodology and practices, please read our FAQs available on <a href = "https://sonarmentalhealth.com">our website</a>.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sonar determines or is required by law through the Services that a youth or third party is subject to a severe or dangerous health risk (an, "<strong>Acute Risk</strong>"), Sonar will alert such youth's Adult Mental Health Allies, and at Sonar's discretion, the appropriate authorities. If Sonar suspects an Acute Risk, Sonar may share specific details and Third Party Content with the corresponding youth's Mental Health Allies and/or the appropriate authorities. SONAR MAKES NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL PROPERLY ASSESS, SCREEN OR FLAG ANY OR ALL ACUTE RISKS OR POTENTIAL ACUTE RISKS.</p>

                    <h2>Social Media and Third Party Services</h2>
                    <p>You may authorize us to connect to certain Third Party Services and access your posts, images, status updates, likes, interactions, messages, and other content submitted to or created in such Third Party Services ("<strong>Third Party Content</strong>"). Our Services will process this Third Party Content to provide assessments on your health and safety and may provide Notifications to you and your Mental Health Allies based on this Third Party Content.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>When you access Third Party Services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Sonar is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service you connect to from the Services.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Sonar has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third Party Service. In addition, Sonar will not and cannot verify, censor or edit the content of any Third Party Service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any Third Party Service.</p>
                    <h2>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions</h2>
                    <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not connect to a Third Party Service or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including Sonar);</li>
                        <li>Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;</li>
                        <li>Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>
                    <h2>Fees and Payment</h2>
                    <p>On the registration page, you may select your desired term length and renewal terms for the Services. You hereby agree to make the payments in accordance with the payment terms that correspond with your selection of Services and term length. If you select a free trial option, you agree that after the free trial period expires, your access to the Services may be terminated or you may be enrolled to the Services for the post-trial term length and according to the billing terms present at the time of your registration.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>You shall provide Sonar with valid and updated credit card information. You authorize Sonar to charge such credit card for all Services selected during registration for the initial subscription term and any corresponding renewal subscription term(s). Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated on the registration page. If the registration page specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, Sonar will invoice you in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant registration page. If not otherwise specified in the registration page, payments will be due within thirty (30) days of invoice and are nonrefundable.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Unpaid fees are subject to a finance charge of one and half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Fees under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes, including national, state or provincial and local use, sales, value-added, property and similar taxes, if any. You agree to pay such taxes (excluding US taxes based on Sonar's net income) unless you have provided Sonar with a valid exemption certificate. In the case of any withholding requirements, you will pay any required withholding itself and will not reduce the amount paid to Sonar on account thereof.</p>
                    <h2>What are my rights in Sonar?</h2>
                    <p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, Third Party Content, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the "<strong>Content</strong>") are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including Sonar's) rights.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>You understand that Sonar owns the Services. You won't modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h2>Do I have to grant any licenses to Sonar or to other users?</h2>
                    <p>In order to process your Third Party Content through the Services, you grant us certain rights in that Third Party Content. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to Third Party Content that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>For all Third Party Content, you hereby grant Sonar a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such Third Party Case, in each case to enable us to operate the Services. This is a license only – your ownership in Third Party Content is not affected. You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Finally, you understand and agree that Sonar, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your Third Party Content to conform and adapt that Third Party Content to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>
                    <h2>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h2>
                    <p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>
                    <p>Contacting Authorities. We provide Notifications regarding our users online activities. If you suspect or determine a threat to the health, welfare, or safety of any individual or entity, you should contact local law enforcement or other governmental agencies to make a report. If we identify information that in our sole discretion indicates health, welfare, or safety concerns for an individual or entity, we have the right, but not the obligation, to make reports to law enforcement or other appropriate governmental agencies and you and all users and Mental Health Allies consent to our authority to do so. Please note that we do not search for, monitor, or report online activity concerning reproductive health.</p>
                    <h2>Will Sonar ever change the Services?</h2>
                    <p>We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you when practical.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>
                    <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.sonarmentalhealth.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What if I want to stop using Sonar?</h2>
                    <p>You're free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@sonarmentalhealth.com; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Sonar is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Sonar has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
                    <h2>What about my privacy?</h2>
                    <p>Sonar takes the privacy of its users very seriously. Please refer to our current Sonar Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<strong>COPPA</strong>") requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.

                            <p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to their conflict-of-law provisions. You and Sonar agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California (collectively, the "<strong>San Francisco Courts</strong>") for any actions which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.

The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Sonar agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Sonar, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.

                            <h4>Mandatory, Bilateral Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions</h4>
                            <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. YOU AND SONAR AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF SONAR, TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED BY OR THROUGH SONAR, TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO THE CONTENT, AND/OR USER SUBMISSION ON SONAR SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include your or Sonar's right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court in San Francisco to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. An arbitrator, however, can award on individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>"<strong>Disputes</strong>" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Sonar against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way from the Service, the Content, User Submission, including but not limited to sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and Sonar, even if the claim arises after you or Sonar has terminated Service or a user account. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; or (b) that Sonar brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Sonar, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms or out of a prior set of Terms with Sonar; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or a class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms.

                            <h4>Dispute Notice
                            </h4>
                            <p>Before initiating an arbitration, you and Sonar each agree to first provide the other a written notice ("<strong>Notice of Dispute</strong>"), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute should be emailed to: <a href="mailto:support@sonarmentalhealth.com">support@sonarmentalhealth.com</a>. Sonar will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address associated with your User ID. You and Sonar agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until this 45-day post-notice resolution period expires. If an agreement cannot be reached within 45 days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Sonar may commence an arbitration proceeding.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Arbitration Process and Procedure</h4>
                            <p>Unless you and Sonar agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall (1) be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("<strong>JAMS</strong>"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect (the "<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>") and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees; (2) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place in the county where you reside. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the "<strong>Minimum Standards</strong>"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action. Further, unless both you and Sonar expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims. If this prohibition of class, representative, or consolidated arbitration is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SONAR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The JAMS Rules are available on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and Sonar each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Hearing</h4>
                            <p>If your claim does not exceed $5,000, you and Sonar agree to waive an oral hearing by the arbitrator and the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Sonar submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. To the extent an oral hearing is requested by you or Sonar, or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, you and Sonar agree that the hearing will be conducted telephonically or videographically.</p>
                            <h4>Arbitrators Decision</h4>
                            <p>An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                            <h4>Fees</h4>
                            <p>It is each parties' responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, case management/administrative, and arbitrator fees as set forth in the JAMS Rules. If your claim for damages does not exceed $5,000, Sonar will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
                            <h4>Small Claims & Government Actions</h4>
                            <p>As an alternative to arbitration, you or Sonar may resolve Disputes in a small claims court that has jurisdiction over your claim. These Terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Sonar on your behalf.</p>
